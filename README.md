# Highlights-Video-Generator🎬
This is simple project which creates a small highlight video of size 44 seconds from our long input video, no matter the size. This helps in getting a summarized form of the video which can be useful for on the go analysis, in case we wish to find the content of long video without actually going through the entire video.
